# Customer Churn Prediction Model ðŸ“Š

Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction Model project! In this project, we aim to develop a powerful machine learning model that can predict customer churn, helping businesses understand and reduce customer attrition. Whether you're interested in data science, customer analytics, or business optimization, you're in the right place.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** The primary goal of this project is to build an accurate predictive model that can identify customers at risk of churning, allowing businesses to take proactive measures to retain them.

- **Dataset:** We leverage a comprehensive dataset containing customer-related information, including demographics, usage patterns, and customer service interactions. This dataset serves as the foundation for our predictive modeling efforts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started with this project, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/mohammedijaj/customer-churn-prediction-model.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd customer-churn-prediction-model
   ```

3. Install the necessary libraries:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook to explore the project:

   ```shell
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Within the notebook, you'll find several essential files

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are highly encouraged! Whether you want to enhance the predictive models, create informative visualizations, or improve project documentation, your contributions are welcome. Simply fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.


## Acknowledgments

I'd like to express our gratitude to the data source provider for making the customer dataset available for analysis and prediction.

If you have any questions, ideas, or suggestions for improvement, please feel free to reach out. Let's work together to predict and prevent customer churn! ðŸ“ŠðŸ‘¥
